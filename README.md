### Sticky Notes App 📝
>Status: *Completed*

A Sticky Note App! As an aspiring developer, I decided to undertake this newbie endeavor to deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hands-on project allows me to apply my technical skills in a practical manner while exploring the exciting world of front-end development. By creating this app, I aim to gain valuable experience in building user interfaces, manipulating DOM elements, and handling user interactions. Through this journey, I hope to refine my abilities and become proficient in coding.
